# Python Script Template

This is a code template that can be used as a starting point for developing a Course Manager Script in Python.

## Requirements

This template and the supporting scripts should work on Linux and macOS. 

In addition, building a script from this template requires Docker to run containers. The `docker` utility should be on your system path.

Access to the Course Manager API is required to build and publish packages to Course Manager. Before getting started, login as an administrator to Course Manager, access Admin menu > API keys, and create a new API key/secret pair to use. If you do not see this menu option, please contact Skytap Support to have API access enabled for your account.

Scripts developed from this template require **Course Manager Script Host v10 or higher** for full compatibility.

## Using This Template

* Make a copy of this template to a new directory, ensuring that symlinks are followed (e.g. using `cp -rL`). It may be most convenient to download a fresh copy using a command like:
    ```
    curl -LO https://github.com/skytap/course-manager-examples/raw/master/script-templates/python.zip && unzip -d myscript python.zip
    ```
* The `script` directory is where your code will go. `script/script.py` is the entry point -- replace the sample code it contains with your own. You're welcome to add other files and directories under `script/` for use in the script.
* Add any pip packages required by your script to `script/requirements.txt`. Packages will be built in a Linux container to ensure the architecture matches the runtime environment of the Script Host.
* To test running your script, run the `bin/run` command. This will run your code in a container, in a fashion similar to that used by the Script Host.
* To publish your script to Course Manager, run `bin/publish`. This will build the dependencies, create a ZIP package, and push it to your Course Manager course. Upon first run, you will be prompted for the necessary details, which will be saved in a ` .publish.yml` file for subsequent runs.

## Accessing Metadata & Control Endpoint From Your Script

The Skytap Metadata Service provides read-only metadata about the Skytap environment hosting an end user's lab. The Course Manager Control Endpoint provides metadata oriented around the end user lab itself, and it also allows limited modifications of the metadata and state of the lab. This template provides `SkytapMetadata` and `LabControl` classes, which provide lightweight interfaces to these two service endpoints that can be used from your script code. These classes make it easier to consume the Metadata and Control Endpoint services. In addition, they make it easier to develop your scripts locally.

### SkytapMetadata Interface

The `SkytapMetadata` class is required in your `script.py` by default:

```
from skytap_metadata import SkytapMetadata
```

`SkytapMetadata` is a singleton. To use it, get a reference to its instance:

```
metadata = SkytapMetadata()
```

Then, you can call methods as follows:

```
metadata.metadata()                               # => returns Skytap metadata as a hash
metadata.user_data()                              # => parses the Skytap metadata's "user_data" attribute, which is typically JSON for Course Manager-provisioned labs, as a hash and then returns it
metadata.configuration_user_data()                # => parses the Skytap metadata's "configuration_user_data" attribute, which is typically JSON for Course Manager-provisioned labs, as a hash and returns it
metadata.control_url()                            # => returns the control endpoint URL
```

### LabControl Interface
The `LabControl` class is required in your `script.py` by default:

```
from lab_control import LabControl
```

`LabControl` is a singleton. To use it, get a reference to its instance:

```
control = LabControl()
```

Then, you can call methods as follows:

```
control.control_data()                            # => returns control metadata as a hash
control.update_control_data(data)                 # => updates control data (see below)
control.refresh_content_pane()                    # => requests any open content panes for the lab to refresh
control.refresh_lab()                             # => requests any open learning consoles for the lab to refresh their Skytap environment view
```

#### Updating Control Data

The `update_control_data` method can be used to achieve the following:

Change runstate:
```
control.update_control_data({ "runstate": "running" })    # or "suspended", "halted", "stopped"
```

Update metadata or sensitive metadata:
```
control.update_control_data({ "metadata": { "AcmeDataProUsername": "user_assigned_from_script" }, "sensitive_metadata": { "AcmeDataProPassword": "password_assigned_from_script" } })
```

Update metadata or sensitive metadata for the associated `course`, `feature` (Events or Labs), `event` (for event participants only), or `user` (for on-demand labs provisioned on the My Labs page only):

```
control.update_control_data({ "course": { "metadata": { "course_last_provisioned": "07/17/2023 17:48:32"} }, "feature": { "sensitive_metadata": { "password": 'secret'} } })
```

### Metadata Stub Service

A challenge in developing scripts that interact with lab metadata is that it is only available from within a Skytap environment. To help with this, the `bin/run` script runs a "metadata stub" service, simulating the behavior of the Metadata Service and Control Endpoint locally and returning stubbed data. If you would like to modify the stubbed data returned when running your script locally, simply modify the files in `lib/script_support/stub_data`.
