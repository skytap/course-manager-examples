# Course Manager Publish Course Manual script

## How this script works

This script uses the Skytap Course Manager API to upload a manual and its attachments.

To authenticate to Course Manager, the script needs an API key and secret generated in Course Manager.

## Getting started

Edit the variables at the top of the publish_manual.sh script and run it locally or as part of an automated action.
