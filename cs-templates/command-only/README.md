# Skytap Cloud Scripts - Command Only Template

This is a code template that can be used as a starting point for developing a "command only" Skytap Cloud Scripts script. It is intended to simply execute a command on an image, with no customer-provided code files.

## Using This Template

Simply update the run spec definition (e.g. config/run/default.yml) with your desired image, command, and other configuration as appropriate.
